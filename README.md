- 👋 Hi, I’m Attila Szep.
     I just finished my undergraduate studies at the University of West London, majoring in IT. 
     I have loved and extensively practised programming for quite some time. 
     And now I received a 1st class qualification at the university.
     I also used GitHub with my university account during my university years. 
     I uploaded quite a few projects/repositories there. 
     But I can't access that account, I'll try some more things about it. 
     Until then, I will use this account.
- 👀 I’m interested in IT and within that, I am now interested in Machine Learning and AI and their extension in the direction of Cyber Security. 
- 🌱 I am currently learning these as well.
- 💞️I am looking to collaborate with those who are interested in this.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
